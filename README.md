### Alternative: Use Custom LASSO GPT

You can also use the **Custom LASSO GPT**: [Custom LASSO GPT Link](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Sk9aML52k-lasso).  
This option:  
- Opens a separate window with a custom-trained GPT assistant knowledgeable about the tool and orbital dynamics.  
- Requires less setup but doesn't enable direct interaction through the MATLAB App.
